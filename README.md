##About
[Update News](http://news-update.helioho.st/) is a proof-of-concept project that uses OpenAI neural networks as assistants in text editing. The project aims to demonstrate how the technology can be used to improve text editing, and uses the text of the [New York Times RSS](https://www.nytimes.com/rss) feed for this purpose.

The project uses Frameworks' [TALL stack](https://tallstack.dev/), which includes:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A CSS framework for quickly creating custom user interfaces.
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/): A lightweight JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications.
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/): A PHP framework for web applications with a focus on elegance and simplicity.
- [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/): A full-stack framework for building dynamic web interfaces with Laravel and Alpine.js.
The [TALL stack](https://tallstack.dev/) is an excellent choice for building web applications quickly and efficiently, and its components work seamlessly together to provide a smooth and responsive user experience.

##How to use
To use News Update, simply visit the project's website at [news-update.helioho.st](http://news-update.helioho.st/). On the home page, you can select the news type and category you want to see from the drop-down menus. Then click the "Convert RSS" button to see the latest news articles from the selected category.

Once the articles are displayed, you can select the one that interests you and click the "Refresh Content" button. After a few seconds you will see both the original and the updated text version of the article. The updated version is generated by OpenAI's neural network, which makes suggestions to improve the text.
